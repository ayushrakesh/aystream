Oct 2023 – Dec 2023
Software Development Intern
Remote
• Contributed in several key features for a student coaching mobile application using Flutter, implementing intuitive
functionalities that significantly enhanced user engagement and streamlined learning experiences.
• Integrated 5+ RESTful APIs and third-party libraries, enhancing app interactivity.
• Engineered responsive and optimized UI/UX designs, ensuring seamless cross-platform performance and consistent user
experiences across iOS and Android devices.

Projects
Allocyte: Custom Linux Memory Manager
Source Code
• Developed a custom heap memory manager in C++ for Linux, implementing allocation and deallocation APIs (mmap,
xfree) to efficiently manage process memory across virtual memory pages, minimizing fragmentation.
• Built thread-safe memory pools leveraging a custom gluethread library with robust doubly linked lists, significantly
optimizing performance by minimizing system calls and context switching in complex multi-threaded environments.
• Seamlessly integrated slab allocation and free-list management using metadata-driven doubly linked lists, effectively
mitigating internal and external fragmentation to maximize memory utilization across diverse application structures.
• Enabled detailed memory usage statistics and debugging tools, tracking per-structure block counts and consumption to
support memory leak analysis, validated through test applications compiled with GCC.
ShipShop: A Database solution
Source Code
• Designed and developed fully a MySQL database for an e-commerce platform from scratch, modeling entities such as,
sessions, products, orders, and refunds, and implemented foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity across tables.
• Implemented advanced SQL logic including a trigger (insert orders) to auto-populate aggregated order summaries after
order items inserts, and a procedure (order performance) to report revenue and order counts over custom date ranges.
• Built analytical views (monthly orders, monthly sessions, monthly website sessions) to calculate revenue and monitor
traffic segmented by marketing source and campaign, supporting performance tracking and business decision making.
• Optimized SQL query performance through strategic indexing on order items(product id) and order items(created at),
reducing full table scans and cutting scan cost from 1607 to 186 rows, as validated via EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
Visinetra: Network Visibility & Telemetry Automation
Source Code
• Designed Ansible playbooks to automate a client-server network in GNS3, deploying Nginx, firewall rules, and static
routing on Linux containers, configuring IP forwarding and NAT for internet access, showcasing automation expertise.
• Deployed a monitoring stack using Telegraf to collect system and SNMP metrics from Linux hosts, storing them in
InfluxDB for real-time Grafana visualization, showcasing expertise in observability and network instrumentation.
• Created a custom traffic generation script on Client1 to simulate HTTP requests to Server1, enabling performance
analysis under load with Grafana monitoring, demonstrating strong network testing and system administration skills.
